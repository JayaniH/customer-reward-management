# customer-reward-management

A User on our site selects a particular reward deal, the deal means that as he accepts the T&Cs we call a workflow that gets the Users details from our Loyalty Engine and then passes the information to the Reward Vendor and once the Reward Vendor receives the information they send a 200 and then POST a 16 digit number to us and we then turn that number into a QR Code and store it on the Users profile. They can use it for a discount.
